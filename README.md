Description
===========

Integrate mailchimp email campaign service with your wordpress blog new user registration form. When you allow anyone to register on your blog, their information is save to a mailchimp list and campaign automatically. This makes it easy to create your own mailing list to solicit your products and services through a recognize email marketer.

Additionally, mailchimp maintains a list of spammer emails and will automatically detect if the registered user is a spammer.

An added feature, includes a jquery popup modal dialog to show your custom terms of use with an Accept and Decline button. If the Accept button is not pressed, then the Register button remains disabled, thus preventing unwanted registered users. No need for capcha here as the user must click a popup and accept button.

Have you ever wanted to automatically include register users in an email marketing campaign?

Would you like extra protection from spammers when you open registration of your blog to permit anyone can register?

Mailchimp-as-a-registration adds a layer of protection to your wordpress blog by automatically adding new users to a mailchimp list campaign at the time of registration, when the user is most acceptable to providing their email address. Users are aware that if you open registration to everyone, and only permit comments from registered users, they know they must provide a valid email in order to receive the password from wordpress.

If you are hosting your blog on a free provider that has disabled the php mail function, mailchimp sends the email to the new user with their username and password.

Additionally, this plugin also provides a popup modal terms dialog, that forces the users to accept the terms if they want to register for your blog. This happens, when they press Accept on the terms dialog, the Register button will then become enable and clickable to register the new user, otherwise the button remains disabled and the user cannot register.
