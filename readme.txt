== Description ==
Integrate mailchimp email campaign service with your wordpress blog new user registration form. When you allow anyone to register on your blog, their information is save to a mailchimp list and campaign automatically. This makes it easy to create your own mailing list to solicit your products and services through a recognize email marketer.

Additionally, mailchimp maintains a list of spammer emails and will automatically detect if the registered user is a spammer.

An added feature, includes a jquery popup modal dialog to show your custom terms of use with an Accept and Decline button. If the Accept button is not pressed, then the Register button remains disabled, thus preventing unwanted registered users. No need for capcha here as the user must click a popup and accept button.
